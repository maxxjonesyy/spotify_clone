# Spotify Clone

Small web app I created with the Spotify API. It's a straightforward application that displays some of the users' information [Playlists, Top artists, Recently played]. A search feature has also been incorporated, showing [Top search, Songs, Recommended artists, Top search albums].

This app does not allow for the writing of user information, it is for display purposes only!

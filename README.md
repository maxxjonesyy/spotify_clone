About 
---
Small web app I created with the Spotify API. It's a very simple application that displays some of the users information [Playlists, Top artists, Recently played]. A search feature has also been incorporated displaying [Top search, Songs, Recommended artists, Top search albums].

This web-app does not allow for the writing of user information, it is for display purposes only!
